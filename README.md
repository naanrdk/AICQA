# AI-Driven Code Quality Analyzer

This project provides a placeholder implementation for an AI-driven code quality analyzer. It includes a skeleton framework for integrating an AI model to analyze code for bugs, performance issues, and code smells.

## Getting Started

To get started with this code quality analyzer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. No additional dependencies are required for this placeholder implementation.

3. **Replace Placeholder with Actual Model:** Replace the `CodeAnalyzer` class with an actual integration of your AI model. This involves implementing the `analyze_code` method to interact with your AI model, including any pre-processing of code and handling of analysis results.

4. **Run the Code Analyzer:** Run the `main()` function to simulate code analysis using the placeholder AI model. This will analyze a sample code file (`my_code.py`) and print the analysis results to the console.

5. **Integration:** Integrate this code quality analyzer with your IDE or CI/CD pipeline to automate code analysis during development or as part of your deployment process.

## Usage

The provided `CQA` class offers the following functionalities:

- `analyze_file(filename)`: Analyzes a single code file using the AI model.
- `analyze_directory(directory)`: Analyzes all code files within a directory.
- `generate_report(analysis_results)`: Generates a report on code quality metrics (currently a placeholder).

You can utilize these functions to analyze individual files or entire directories of code.
